Industry Overview of Non-Stick Coatings Market
Non-stick coating refers to a protective layer applied to a surface that reduces its adhesion to other materials. This coating is typically made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which minimizes the sticking properties of the surface. Common types of non-stick coatings include ceramic, siloxane-based, Teflon, anodized aluminum, enameled cast iron, and carbon steel. These coatings are known for their ease of use, resistance to heat, chemicals, and cold, as well as their excellent electrical properties. As a result, non-stick coatings have a wide range of applications in industries such as textiles, carpets, industrial machinery, electronics, and medical and cookware appliances.
